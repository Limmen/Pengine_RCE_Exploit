# RCE Exploit for a Vulnerable Pengine Server

An exploit to obtain remote code execution (RCE) on a remote server that runs an SLD resolution service through the Prolog library *Pengines*. The exploit uses the PLTP protocol and a vulnerability in Pengine servers that are not sandboxed. The vulnerability allows a client to upload malicious Prolog code. I show how this can be used to obtain a reverse shell with netcat. Although the Prolog community is aware of this vulnerability, to the best of my knowledge, this is the first report that demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited by an adversary. My goal is that this report can increase awareness among Pengine users and make them more inclined to use the sandbox security mechanism to prevent the exploit.
